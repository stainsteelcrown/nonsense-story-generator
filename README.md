nonsense-story-generator
========================

Beginning from a simple python program this repository will develop into a simple web application which will allow users to create their own stories one line at a time.  The basic concept there will be a beginning single story line generated either by the user or other method.  From the first line the user is prompted to write the next line.  Then they can invite their friends or strangers from the internet to write the next line.  Here's the catch.  The next user only gets to see the last line written, not the entire story.  Once the story is complete all the users will get a link to the final nonsense story.  Hilarity ensues.
